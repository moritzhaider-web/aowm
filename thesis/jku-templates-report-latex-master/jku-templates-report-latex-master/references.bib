	abstract="Scientific communities are using an increasing number of ontologies and vocabularies. Currently, the problem lies in the difficulty to find and select them for a specific knowledge engineering task. Thus, there is a real need to precisely describe these ontologies with adapted metadata, but none of the existing metadata vocabularies can completely meet this need if taken independently. In this paper, we present a new version of Metadata vocabulary for Ontology Description and publication, referred as MOD 1.2 which succeeds previous work published in 2015. It has been designed by reviewing in total 23 standard existing metadata vocabularies (e.g., Dublin Core, OMV, DCAT, VoID) and selecting relevant properties for describing ontologies. Then, we studied metadata usage analytics within ontologies and ontology repositories. MOD 1.2 proposes in total 88 properties to serve both as (i) a vocabulary to be used by ontology developers to annotate and describe their ontologies, or (ii) an explicit OWL vocabulary to be used by ontology libraries to offer semantic descriptions of ontologies as linked data. The experimental results show that MOD 1.2 supports a new set of queries for ontology libraries. Because MOD is still in early stage, we also pitch the plan for a collaborative design and adoption of future versions within an international working group.",

	abstract = {In recent years, data lakes emerged as a way to manage large amounts of heterogeneous data for modern data analytics. One way to prevent data lakes from turning into inoperable data swamps is semantic data management. Such approaches propose the linkage of metadata to knowledge graphs based on the Linked Data principles to provide more meaning and semantics to the data in the lake. Such a semantic layer may be utilized not only for data management but also to tackle the problem of data integration from heterogeneous sources, in order to make data access more expressive and interoperable. In this survey, we review recent approaches with a specific focus on the application within data lake systems and scalability to Big Data. We classify the approaches into (i) basic semantic data management, (ii) semantic modeling approaches for enriching metadata in data lakes, and (iii) methods for ontology-based data access. In each category, we cover the main techniques and their background, and compare latest research. Finally, we point out challenges for future work in this research area, which needs a closer integration of Big Data and Semantic Web technologies.},

	ABSTRACT = {The complexity of cancer research stems from leaning on several biomedical disciplines for relevant sources of data, many of which are complex in their own right. A holistic view of cancer—which is critical for precision medicine approaches—hinges on integrating a variety of heterogeneous data sources under a cohesive knowledge model, a role which biomedical ontologies can fill. This study reviews the application of ontologies and knowledge graphs in cancer research. In total, our review encompasses 141 published works, which we categorized under 14 hierarchical categories according to their usage of ontologies and knowledge graphs. We also review the most commonly used ontologies and newly developed ones. Our review highlights the growing traction of ontologies in biomedical research in general, and cancer research in particular. Ontologies enable data accessibility, interoperability and integration, support data analysis, facilitate data interpretation and data mining, and more recently, with the emergence of the knowledge graph paradigm, support the application of Artificial Intelligence methods to unlock new knowledge from a holistic view of the available large volumes of heterogeneous data.},

	abstract = {Due to the growing number of architecturally complex buildings built in recent decades, mobile building inspection robot systems are required to operate in increasingly complex environments. This leads to higher requirements for their hardware design. The existing literature on the design of building inspection robots has implicitly mentioned the impact of building environments and building defects on defining robot hardware design requirements. However, the explicit representation of what information is required to define a specific hardware requirement is stimissing. To fill this gap, this paper presents an ontology that provides an overview of the building and inspection domain objects that affect the determination of robot hardware design requirements (RoboDesign). It also explores the relationship between specific robot hardware requirements and features of complex buildings and their defects. The RoboDesign ontology integrates two main domain ontology models including a Robot System Model and a Building and Defect Model. A content evaluation and an automated consistency checking are conducted for the internal evaluation of the ontology. Additionally, the proposed ontology is implemented in two wall-climbing inspection robot design cases to check if the investigation of the robot’s application environment is comprehensive. The validation results also demonstrate that the use of the proposed ontological model allows to efficiently retrieve information required to determine a particular hardware requirement.},

	ABSTRACT = {This research aims to investigate the roles of ontology and Semantic Web Technologies (SWT) in modern knowledge representation and data management. By analyzing a dataset of 10,037 academic articles from Web of Science (WoS) published in the last 6 years (2019–2024) across several fields, such as computer science, engineering, and telecommunications, our research identifies important trends in the use of ontologies and semantic frameworks. Through bibliometric and semantic analyses, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERT-clustering approach, we map the evolution of semantic technologies, revealing core research themes such as ontology engineering, knowledge graphs, and linked data. Furthermore, we address existing research gaps, including challenges in the semantic web, dynamic ontology updates, and scalability in Big Data environments. By synthesizing insights from the literature, our research provides an overview of the current state of semantic web research and its prospects. With a 0.75 coherence score and perplexity = 48, the topic modeling analysis identifies three distinct thematic clusters: (1) Ontology-Driven Knowledge Representation and Intelligent Systems, which focuses on the use of ontologies for AI integration, machine interpretability, and structured knowledge representation; (2) Bioinformatics, Gene Expression and Biological Data Analysis, highlighting the role of ontologies and semantic frameworks in biomedical research, particularly in gene expression, protein interactions and biological network modeling; and (3) Advanced Bioinformatics, Systems Biology and Ethical-Legal Implications, addressing the intersection of biological data sciences with ethical, legal and regulatory challenges in emerging technologies. The clusters derived from BERT embeddings and clustering show thematic overlap with the LDA-derived topics but with some notable differences in emphasis and granularity. Our contributions extend beyond theoretical discussions, offering practical implications for enhancing data accessibility, semantic search, and automated knowledge discovery.},
