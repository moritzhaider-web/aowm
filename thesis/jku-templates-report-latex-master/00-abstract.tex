The Semantic Web aims to enhance data interoperability and knowledge exchange by providing machine-readable semantics for information on the web. Ontologies play a central role in this ecosystem, as they formally define domain concepts and their interrelations, thereby enabling shared understanding and automated reasoning. However, the discovery, reuse, and maintenance of ontologies remain challenging tasks. One major limitation is the lack of standardized and comprehensive metadata vocabularies for annotating ontologies. This thesis addresses the problem of non-standardized ontology metadata annotation by analyzing existing vocabularies, identifying common practices, and developing an extended vocabulary that combines and reuses established metadata standards. The proposed vocabulary aims to support interoperability and provide a structured approach for ontology documentation and reuse. Through this analysis and vocabulary design, the thesis contributes to the standardization and improvement of ontology metadata annotation practices within the Semantic Web community.
